# Comprehensive Learning Plan

This structured learning plan is designed to help you develop essential skills in C# and web application development. Each phase builds upon the previous one, with clear objectives, actionable tasks, and resources to support your progress. Check off tasks as you complete them!

## Phase 1: C# Basics and Fundamentals

**Objective:** Refresh foundational C# skills, including variables, loops, methods, classes, and interfaces, to build a strong base for more advanced topics.

- [ ] Variables ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/))
- [ ] Loops ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/control-flow/for-and-foreach-loops))
- [ ] Methods ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods))
- [ ] Classes ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/))
- [ ] Inheritance ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance))
- [ ] Interfaces ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/))

### Exercises

- Write a simple calculator program that uses methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Create a class to represent a book and include methods for borrowing and returning books.
- Refactor an existing program to use interfaces for better flexibility.

## Phase 2: Intermediate C# and Web Development

**Objective:** Build on foundational knowledge by learning to use Entity Framework, Dependency Injection, and MVC for real-world application development.
