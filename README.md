# C# Learning Plan

This is a simple web application that provides a structured learning plan for C# and ASP.NET Core development. It allows users to track their progress by checking off completed sections.

## Key Features

*   **Structured Learning Plan**: The application is divided into sections, each focusing on a specific topic in C# and ASP.NET Core development.
*   **Progress Tracking**: Users can mark sections as complete and track their overall progress using a progress bar.
*   **Interactive UI**: The application features a responsive design with a sidebar for navigation and smooth scrolling.

## Recent Improvements

This project has been recently updated to improve security and testing. Here's a summary of the changes:

*   **Security**: The Supabase service key has been removed from the client-side code to prevent unauthorized access to the database. The application now uses a placeholder for an anonymous key, and it is recommended to enable Row Level Security (RLS) in the Supabase project for enhanced security.
*   **Testing**: The C# Playwright tests have been refactored for better performance and maintainability. The tests now run against the local `index.html` file, making them easier to run during development. A new test has been added to verify the functionality of the progress bar.

## Future Improvements

Here are some suggestions for further improving the application:

*   **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to track their progress independently.
*   **Backend API**: Create a backend API to handle the business logic and data persistence. This would allow for more complex features and better separation of concerns.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process.
*   **Enhanced UX**: Improve the user experience with a more intuitive design and additional features, such as the ability to add notes or comments to each section.
